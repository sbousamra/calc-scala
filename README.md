# calc-scala

calc-scala is a project aimed at creating my own basic language that deals with basic operators such as add, subtract, multiply, divide.
The main goal is to pass in input in the form of a <B>string</B> into parsers, that returns types that can be evaluated with methods we've defined.

For example: 

1  
(1 + 2)  
(1 + (1 + 2))  
x = (1 + 2)  
x  
y  
print(x + 3)

This is a list of statements in the form of a string. We should be able to parse this into our program and evaluate the expressions wanted.
# Goals

##### Learn about parsers, what is a parser, why is it useful?
##### Learning how to abstractly define our own types for our language
##### Learn about the atto basic parser library
